	<h2>Project Description</h2>
	<p>
		<i
			>In this project, our team built a website that showcases a collection of
			stock photos of flowers provided by a website called Pexels. Using a
			static site generator called Eleventy, our team created a home page
			displaying thumbnails of each photo. We worked exclusively with MVP.css, a
			minimalist stylesheet for HTML elements, and added necessary standard page
			elements. We also created individual pages for each photo using only
			semantic HTML with the exception of using CSS for the page's background
			color with each photo's specific average color field.
